## dev:

short for developer or development, or to things related to development

## sklounst:

*sklounst?*

This is a fabricated word of Keegan-Michael Key that appeared on the skit comedy show called 'Key and Peele'. It has its original meaning from the show's episode where it originally appeared, but it has also taken on an internet cultural meaning of its own. The Urban Dictionary has several, humorful examples...

**sklounst:**

Referring to a serving of something delicious or fun.

As in, *Do you want to dip into the Sklounst?*

--

**sklounst:**

*Messed up*

As in, *Bro I got totally sklounst at that bachelor party in March.*

**sklounst:**

A word that is commonly shouted in moments of disappointment or anger. Or in some cases, it is a word shouted in times of great success.

Example 1-

Frank: "shoot the ball!"

Buddo: "sklounst!!!"

(The ball hits the ground rather than the backboard)

Example 2-

Frank: \<*hits a banger*>

Buddo:"Sklounst!!"

(The ball goes between the goalies legs and the game is won)

**sklounst:**

sklounst: noun- singular/plural- a person or group of people with unsavory attributes; a collection of nefarious characters

Original meaning as it was used in the K&P episode, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiWIOKKuyGE ,

**draxx them sklounst:**

"Blast them up (them terry clowns)"

The scene is set on an airplane, and there's a debate on what to do if terrorists were to hijack the plane.

Drax: verb- to behave in the manner of the Marvel comic book and movie character Drax; to act violently with aggression.

*Draxx them sklounst* sounds similar to "blast," "smash," or "hax" "them clowns" or "them [those that should be trounced] clowns."

*Draxx them sklounst:* What you should do "if you see some terries tryin' a get froggy on an airplane."

"If a terry up on this plane even thinking abouts tryin a do something, then we gonna draxx y'em up."

"You're gonna... you're gonna what?"

"We gonna *draxx them sklounst*"

Anyway. Yeah. It takes a certain humor.
