Always be ready.

One should interview at least a few times per year. It does not matter if you are happy where you are.

Reasons for doing this:

- **Practice**. Keep your skills sharp. More than just showmanship of your technical skills: interviewing is negotiation. Negotiation skills are also important in everyday life and work.
- **Disaster recovery**. What if one day you unexpectedly find that you need to pivot. Time is of the essence. You may not have time to practice and catch up on what's hot.
- **Know your worth**. If an offer is received with more total comp than current TC, then it may be time to ask to re-visit current compensation plans.
- **Know the trends**. How is the job market changing? What skills are most in demand now? Career success means looking ahead and knowing what is happening around you.
- **Recruit**. Interviewing with other companies is also a chance to favorably represent your current company. If interviewers are impressed with you, they will remember your current company, and may even consider looking at your current career openings!
- **Accountability**. Interviewing is a form of accountability or motivation to practice and keep fresh your knowledge of data structures and algorithms, system design, problem solving, and quick thinking. Our everyday jobs can stray from these important domains for some stretches of time. So when a project eventually comes up that requires more of these special skills, you can be prepared and thus more efficient in your current role.
